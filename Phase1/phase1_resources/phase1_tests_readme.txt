datamemory_test:
choose ND parameter in test bench same as your module's delay parameter to see results.
file "datamem_test_example.wlf" contains sample waveforms of data memory with ND=3.
you can open it with modelsim.

instructionmemory_test:
memfile.dat is the file of instructions to load in instruction memory.

other tests are simple. simulate your modules using modelsim. check your waveforms.
